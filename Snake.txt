Simple Snake Game in JavaScript

You may code wherever you want.

Ideas / Challenges (optional):

All organized from easiest to hardest
Try to complete as many as you can from each section

Easy:
 - Create a button or key to press to change food location
 - Create a button to invert controls (left is now right and up is now down, etc...)
 - Count and display the score

Medium:
 - Create an acceleration for the snake per score
 - Create a button to turn off the snake's ability to go through walls
 - Create a shop (that pauses the game when you enter it) where you can buy power ups for the snake (one power up could be: one that increases or decreases the snakes speed)

Hard:
 - Create the game using HTML elements rather than a canvas
 - Create the ability to rotate the game 90 degrees
 - Create a fully working automated AI for the game

Max's Impossible Challenge (Please do not attempt these unless extremely comfortable with CS20 JavaScript Concepts):
 - Use WSAD keys combined with Arrow Keys to create a 3D (400x400x400 grid) Snake Game with JavaScript Canvas, then if you have more time, create an AI to play this game.
